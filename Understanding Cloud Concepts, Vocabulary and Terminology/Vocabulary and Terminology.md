## Virtualization ##

Virtualization is a process where the server logically isolted into multiple servers that means if a developer needs only few space in a server the Admins will give the required space using this virtualization process.
We can called those multiple serevrs as **Virtual Machine**.

## Virtual Machine ##

Virtual Machine **(VM)** is nothing but a software based emulation of a physical computer, allowing you o run an operating system and applications using virtual resources from the host system, essentially creating a **"computer within a computer"**.

## API (Application Programming Interface) ##

API's will allows you to communicate/exchange data between two systems. it defines how software components should interact.

## Regions ##

Regions refers to a geographical area where a cloud service provider (like AWS, Azure, or GCP) has established data centers and infrastructure to offer its services. Each region contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones ##

Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically isolated data center or set of data centers within a region, designed to ensure high availability and fault tolerance by allowing applications to run across multiple locations, preventing a single point of failure. If one AZ experiences an outage (due to a natural disaster, power failure, or other issues), applications and data can continue to operate in the other AZs within the same region, ensuring minimal downtime and service disruption. 

## Scalability ##

Scalability refers to the ability of the cloud platform to dynamically adjust resources to handle varying workload demands, ensuring optimal performance and availability. It is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

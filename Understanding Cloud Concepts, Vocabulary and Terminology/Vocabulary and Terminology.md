## Virtualization ##

Virtualization is a process where the server logically isolted into multiple servers that means if a developer needs only few space in a server the Admins will give the required space using this virtualization process.
We can called those multiple serevrs as **Virtual Machine**.

## Virtual Machine ##

Virtual Machine **(VM)** is nothing but a software based emulation of a physical computer, allowing you o run an operating system and applications using virtual resources from the host system, essentially creating a **"computer within a computer"**.

## API (Application Programming Interface) ##

API's will allows you to communicate/exchange data between two systems. it defines how software components should interact.

## Regions ##

Regions refers to a geographical area where a cloud service provider (like AWS, Azure, or GCP) has established data centers and infrastructure to offer its services. Each region contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones ##

Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically isolated data center or set of data centers within a region, designed to ensure high availability and fault tolerance by allowing applications to run across multiple locations, preventing a single point of failure. If one AZ experiences an outage (due to a natural disaster, power failure, or other issues), applications and data can continue to operate in the other AZs within the same region, ensuring minimal downtime and service disruption. 

## Scalability ##

Scalability refers to the ability of the cloud platform to dynamically adjust resources to handle varying workload demands, ensuring optimal performance and availability. It is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.


## Elasticity ##

Elasticity refers to the ability of a system to automatically and dynamically adjust resources (like compute, memory, and storage) up or down to match fluctuating workload demands, without manual intervention. This is a key characteristic of cloud computing, enabling efficient resource utilization and cost optimization.

## Agility ##

Agility refers to the ability to quickly adapt to changing business needs by rapidly provisioning and de-provisioning resources. In Cloud Computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.

## High Availability ##

High Availability (HA) ensures applications remain accessible with minimal downtime through redundancy, fault tolerance, and failover mechanisms, utilizing services like Availability Sets and Zones. It ensures accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

## Fault Tolerance ##

Fault Tolerance ensures a system continues operating despite component failures, enhancing reliability and availability by employing redundancy and failover mechanisms.It  is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.

## Disaster Recovery ##

Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

## Load Balancing ##

Load Balancing is a cloud networking service that distributes network traffic across multiple servers (VMs or VMSS) to improve application performance, availability, and scalability.
